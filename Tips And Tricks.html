			1. Spamming E and right click on the M.U.L.E lets you deposit faster. <br />  <br /> 2. The Scout is able to clip through the drop pod at the end of the mission to help it end faster. <br /> <br /> 3. You can catch the Caretaker batteries and use them as explosives against enemies. <br /> <br /> 4. The Engineer is able to save himself with his own platform gun. <br /> <br /> 5. Falling on a dwarves head prevents all fall damage. <br /> <br /> 6. holding E on a refinery pipe forces a stop at a build spot, or a oil spill. <br /> <br /> 7. The scout can heavily reduce fall damage if you shoot the ground with the special powder overclock. <br /> <br /> 8. The Gunner ziplines are able to be traversed faster if you jump and re-catch the zipline over and over.
